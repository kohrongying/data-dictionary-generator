### Problem: 
Generating data dictionary from scratch

### Pre-requisites: 
Using flyway for migrations
Installed docker and docker-compose

### How to use

# Enhancements
1. combine table json output for table?
2. installer pdf maker (node/python?)
3. set absolute path for migration as custom variable
